Batch based graphics program. Commands are read from an input
file. The output file can be read with libgfx.

usage: gfxgen -i <input file> -o <output file>

Commands:

object		foobar		# Start object with the name foobar
frame		foobar/0.tga	# This image will be frame 0
frame		foobar/1.tga	# And this will be frame 1
rgb_to_alpha	000000		# Translate black to transparent
autocrop_alpha			# Autocrop by alpha == 0
scale_maxspect	40 40		# Scale frames to a size of max 40 x 40
				# pixels
end		gfx alpha cm !	# Terminate object foobar. Save 16 bit
				# graphics data, 8 bit _special_ alpha
				# chanel and 1 bit 32 bit alligned
				# collition mask.

The images 0.tga and 1.tga must be of equal size.

The hotspot is set to the middle of the object when doing a
scale_maxspect. Maybe I'll add a hotspot command some day.
