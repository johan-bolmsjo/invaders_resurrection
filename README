A space invaders game, insanely complicated done. One can either use
my NEO Linux frame buffer library or SDL with it.

These are the configure flags that can be used:
  --enable-audio-44kHz    Use 44kHz audio mode
  --enable-fullscreen     Use full screen video mode
  --enable-debug          Compile with debug information
  --with-libneo           Use libneo as media library
  --with-libsdl           Use libSDL as media library

To build the game, first make sure that NEO or SDL is installed. You
probably want to use SDL even if NEO works best with this game, at
least at the moment. NEO provides solid 1 sync screen update, while
SDL is a bit jerky.

Get the NEO library at:
http://johan.nocrew.org/software-neo/

Get the SDL library at:
http://www.libsdl.org/

Example:
$ ./configure --with-libsdl --enable-fullscreen
$ make
$ su -c 'make install-strip'

Keys to use in the game:

SPACE	Fire
ESCAPE	Quit
Z	Turn left
X	Turn right
P	Create snapshot (invaders_snap.tga)

There is joystick support as well.

BUGS:
- When using SDL and running as root in XFree86 4.0, the timing is
fucked up. Might be under other circumstances as well.
- The sound effects are cut off, especially noticeable with SDL.
