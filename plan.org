* TODO Compile graphics assets automatically
** Background
There are two data files =data/invaders.gfx.deflate= and
=data/pearl_8x8.dat.deflate= that contain pre-compiled graphics data.
These files are included into the compiled game by generating character
arrays with their data.

First of all both of these are in a deflate format that no standard
tools can decompress. Some lesser used functions of zlib are used to
compress and decompress data in this format.

There are two tools in the source tree: =src/tools/compress.c= that
compress a data file into the deflate format and =src/gfxgen= that
assembles the graphics files into an asset bundle that is then
compressed in standard gzip format.

I have no recollection of why =gfxgen= emits a gzip file when the game
wants it in deflate format as created by =compress=.

Update [2023-11-12]: I now believe this was done as part of embedding
the assets into the executable file.

When it comes to the font =pearl_8x8.dat.deflate=, there doesn't seem to
be any source graphics data. We have to accept that that is lost to time.

** Tasks
- [ ] Make sure that the data file =invaders.gfx.deflate= is generated
  automatically as part of the build.
  Alternatives:
  + Remove gzip compression from =gfxgen= and deflate compress with =compress=
  + Use gzip compression instead of deflate.
- [ ] Convert the font =pearl_8x8.dat.deflate= to gzip format if choosen
  for the graphics data bundle.

* TODO Revise sound mixing
The sound is generally glitchy with SDL 1.x. It worked better with the
NEO sound API for which the code was originally written.

- Implement robust sound playback using SDL 2
- Ensure low latency

** Update [2024-04-21 Sun]

After some research, I don't think sound playback is that buggy. Based
on how SDL works with sound, I don't think it can be improved without
altering the strategy for sound effect playback.

The problem is that the application has no way to control actual audio
queue depth. The main problem is the very short sounds when the bomber
armada moves at high speed. The sounds are cut off because of the
inexact playback. A viable strategy could be that instead of emitting
sounds from the game loop, the sound effect playback effectively
operates in a "tracker mode", so that the next sound effect is scheduled
automatically when the previous one terminates.

* TODO Make a webassembly port using https://emscripten.org

* Game play improvements
** TODO Increase missile rate when looping armada
Increase missile rate when armada is looped after three screens.

** TODO Missile shoot down effect
Sound + particles

** TODO Bonus score based on screen clear speed

** Power-ups
Increased shot speed or double shoots under some conditions?

** Co-op play?
Competing for high best score while clearing the same screens?

* TODO Implement pause screen
- Keys :: Pause
- Buttons :: Start

Dancing aliens?

* TODO CRT shader effect
Feed the rendered image through a CRT shader effect to reduce the blocky appearance of 640x480 resolution.

* Fix old issues listed in TODO file [0/5]
** TODO In space invaders the aliens just pause when the player dies.
** TODO In space invaders you loose all lifes when the aliens hits the bottom.
** TODO Use collision mask in collision detection code.
** TODO Improve shield code.
** TODO Add some sort of queue for the sound effects so they don't get cut off.

* Closed Issues

Bring back joystick support (with SDL 2).

** DONE Remove double buffering                                    :ARCHIVE:

:END:
When the game was made clearing the whole screen each frame was costly in terms of CPU cycles.
There is no longer any reason to do this for such a low resolution game.
Thus remove the double buffering to simplify the code.

** DONE Use SDL version 2                                          :ARCHIVE:

- [X] Fix all warnings
- [X] Compile with =-std=gnu11=

- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2023-02-19 Sun 19:40] \\
  Crashes where caused by one use after free bug related to player shots
  and one buffer overflow bug in the shield handling code.
:END:
May still need to use =-fno-strict-aliasing=, we'll see.
- [X] Compile with optimization (-O2).

** DONE Remove support for the NEO frame buffer library            :ARCHIVE:
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2023-02-18 Sat 18:27]
:END:
Remove support for the NEO frame buffer library as I have no intention of updating it.
The last update was in 2003 and I suppose it's hopelessly obsolete.

** DONE Update build system                                        :ARCHIVE:
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2022-11-01 Tue 00:26]
:END:
Although the configure based build system still almost works 22 years later,
replace it with a pure GNU Makefile based build system.
