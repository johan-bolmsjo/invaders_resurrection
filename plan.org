* TODO Update build system
Although the configure based build system still almost works 22 years later,
replace it with a pure GNU Makefile based build system.

* TODO Make invaders compile cleanly with modern compilers
- [ ] Fix all warnings
- [ ] Compile with =-std=gnu11=
- [ ] Compile with =-Wextra=
- [ ] Compile with =-pedantic=

* TODO Fix bugs related to optimization of modern compilers
May still need to use =-fno-strict-aliasing=, we'll see.

* TODO Use SDL version 2

* TODO Remove support for the NEO frame buffer library
Remove support for the NEO frame buffer library as I have no intention of updating it.
The last update was in 2003 and I suppose it's hopelessly obsolete.

* TODO Remove double buffering
When the game was made clearing the whole screen each frame was costly in terms of CPU cycles.
There is no longer any reason to do this for such a low resolution game.
Thus remove the double buffering to simplify the code.

* TODO CRT shader effect
Feed the rendered image through a CRT shader effect to reduce the blocky appearance of 640x480 resolution.

* Fix old issues listed in TODO file [0/5]
** TODO In space invaders the aliens just pause when the player dies.
** TODO In space invaders you loose all lifes when the aliens hits the bottom.
** TODO Use collision mask in collision detection code.
** TODO Improve shield code.
** TODO Add some sort of queue for the sound effects so they don't get cut off.

* TODO Make a webassembly port using https://emscripten.org

* Closed Issues
